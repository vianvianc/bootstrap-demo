    Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has
    roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over
    2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney
    College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,
    consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the
    word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum
    comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"
    (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a
    treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The
    first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line
    in section 1.10.32. It is a long established fact that a reader will be
    distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The
    point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution
    of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look
    like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors
    now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem
    ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions
    have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose
    (injected humour and the like).
